<li><p><a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0131103628" rel="noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The C Programming Language (2nd Edition)</a> - Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie (1988). Still a good, short but complete introduction to C (C90, not C99 or later versions), written by the inventor of C.  However, the language has changed and good C style has developed in the last 25 years, and there are parts of the book that show its age.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/013089592X" rel="noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">C: A Reference Manual (5th Edition)</a> - Samuel P. Harbison and Guy R. Steele (2002).  An excellent reference book on C, up to and including C99. It is not a tutorial, and probably unfit for beginners. It's great if you need to write a compiler for C, as the authors had to do when they started.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0596004362" rel="noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">C Pocket Reference (O'Reilly)</a> - Peter Prinz and Ulla Kirch-Prinz (2002).</p>

</li>
<li><p>Various versions of the C language standards can be found <a href="http://www.iso-9899.info/wiki/The_Standard" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.  There is an online version of the <a href="http://port70.net/%7Ensz/c/c11/n1570.html" rel="noreferrer">draft C11 standard</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.knosof.co.uk/cbook/cbook.html" rel="noreferrer">The new C standard - an annotated reference</a> (Free PDF) - Derek M. Jones (2009).  The &quot;new standard&quot; referred to is the old C99 standard rather than C11.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/0133976890" rel="noreferrer">C: How to Program (8th Edition)</a> - Paul Deitel and Harvey M. Deitel (2015). Lots of good tips and best practices for beginners. The index is very good and serves as a decent reference (just not fully comprehensive, and very shallow).</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1449399916" rel="noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Head First C</a> - David Griffiths and Dawn Griffiths (2012).</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1718501048" rel="noreferrer">Effective C</a> - Robert C Seacord (2020).  A good introduction to modern C, including chapters on dynamic memory allocation, on program structure, and on debugging, testing and analysis.  It has some pointers toward probable C2x features.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Intermediate</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://modernc.gforge.inria.fr/" rel="noreferrer">Modern C</a> â€” Jens Gustedt (2017 1st Edn; 2020 2nd Edn).  Covers C in 5 levels (encounter, acquaintance, cognition, experience, ambition) from beginning C to advanced C.  It covers C11 and C17, including threads and atomic access, which few other books do. Not all compilers recognize these features in all environments.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/software/cii/" rel="noreferrer">C Interfaces and Implementations</a> - David R. Hanson (1997). Provides information on how to define a boundary between an interface and implementation in C in a generic and reusable fashion. It also demonstrates this principle by applying it to the implementation of common mechanisms and data structures in C, such as lists, sets, exceptions, string manipulation, memory allocators, and more. Basically, Hanson took all the code he'd written as part of building <a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon" rel="noreferrer">Icon</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/software/lcc/" rel="noreferrer">lcc</a> and pulled out the best bits in a form that other people could reuse for their own projects. It's a model of good C programming using modern design techniques (including Liskov's data abstraction), showing how to organize a big C project as a bunch of useful libraries.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201604612" rel="noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The C Puzzle Book</a> - Alan R. Feuer (1998)</p>

<li><p><a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0131315099" rel="noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The Standard C Library</a> - P.J. Plauger (1992). It contains the complete source code to an implementation of the C89 standard library, along with extensive discussions about the design and why the code is designed as shown.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1449327141" rel="noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">21st Century C: C Tips from the New School</a> - Ben Klemens (2012). In addition to the C language, the book explains gdb, valgrind, autotools, and git. The comments on style are found in the last part (Chapter 6 and beyond).</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201314525" rel="noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Algorithms in C</a> - Robert Sedgewick (1997). Gives you a real grasp of implementing algorithms in C. Very lucid and clear; will probably make you want to throw away all of your other algorithms books and keep this one.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0673999866" rel="noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Pointers on C</a> - Kenneth Reek (1997).</li>

Not ideal, but it is worth intermediate programmers practicing problems written in this book. This is a good cookbook-like approach suggested by comp.lang.c contributors.</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.planetpdf.com/codecuts/pdfs/ooc.pdf" rel="noreferrer">Object-oriented Programming with ANSI-C</a> (Free PDF) - Axel-Tobias Schreiner (1993).
The code gets a bit convoluted.  If you want C++, use C++.  It only uses C90, of course.</li>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/101/EssentialC.pdf" rel="noreferrer">Essential C</a> (Free PDF) - Nick Parlante (2003). Note that this describes the C90 language at several points (<em>e.g.</em>, in discussing <code>//</code> comments and placement of variable declarations at arbitrary points in the code), so it should be treated with some caution.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201845199" rel="noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">C Programming FAQs: Frequently Asked Questions</a> - Steve Summit (1995).  This is the book of the web site listed earlier.  It doesn't cover C99 or the later standards.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0596006977" rel="noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">C in a Nutshell</a> - Peter Prinz and Tony Crawford (2005). Excellent book if you need a reference for C99.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201419505" rel="noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Functional C</a> - Pieter Hartel and Henk Muller (1997). Teaches modern practices that are invaluable for low-level programming, with concurrency and modularity in mind.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/020161586X" rel="noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The Practice of Programming</a> - Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike (1999). A very good book to accompany K&amp;R. It uses C++ and Java too.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201179288" rel="noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">C Traps and Pitfalls</a> by A. Koenig (1989). Very good, but the C style pre-dates standard C, which makes it less recommendable these days.</p>
<p><sup>Some have argued for the removal of 'Traps and Pitfalls' from this list because it has trapped some people into making mistakes; others continue to argue for its inclusion.  Perhaps it should be regarded as an 'expert' book because it requires a moderately extensive knowledge of C to understand what's changed since it was published.</sup></p>

<li><p><a href="http://www.misra-c.com/Activities/MISRAC/tabid/160/Default.aspx" rel="noreferrer">MISRA-C</a> - industry standard published and maintained by the Motor Industry Software Reliability Association. Covers C89 and C99.</p>
<p><sup>Although this isn't a book as such, many programmers recommend reading and implementing as much of it as possible. MISRA-C was originally intended as guidelines for safety-critical applications in particular, but it applies to any area of application where stable, bug-free C code is desired (who doesn't want fewer bugs?). MISRA-C is becoming the de facto standard in the whole embedded industry and is getting increasingly popular even in other programming branches. There are (at least) three publications of the standard (1998, 2004, and the current version from 2012). There is also a MISRA Compliance Guidelines document from 2016, and MISRA C:2012 Amendment 1 â€” Additional Security Guidelines for MISRA C:2012 (published in April 2016).</sup></p>
<p><sup>Note that some of the strictures in the MISRA rules are not appropriate to every context. For example, directive 4.12 states &quot;Dynamic memory allocation shall not be used&quot;. This is appropriate in the embedded systems for which the MISRA rules are designed; it is not appropriate everywhere. (Compilers, for instance, generally use dynamic memory allocation for things like symbol tables, and to do without dynamic memory allocation would be difficult, if not preposterous.)</sup></p>
